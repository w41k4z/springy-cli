# springy-cli
A command line tool for the springy framework (linux based for the moment)

## Installation
  Execute the install.sh script
  
  Note: Do not separate the install.sh and springy, just download the source file as it is

> You can place the jar file anywhere you want as it will always be asked when initalizing a springy project

## Getting started
  It is super easy to use, just type
  `$ springy --help`
  for its manual
  
  > Change the springy file chmod (make it executable) if needed
  
  More features and improvement will be comming soon
